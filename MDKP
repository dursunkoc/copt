The exact solution is the branch and bound.
Heuristics:
    1. graceful degradation from the most valuable items based on lagrange multipliers.  --> fails on short resources, and feasible solutuions are few. ?This is way when we add rh the greedy aproach fails?
    2. HEU is based on the aggregate resources
